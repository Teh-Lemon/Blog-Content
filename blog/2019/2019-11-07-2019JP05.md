Ohayou~

Visiting 2 spots today and I won't be coming back to Hiroshima tonight.  
I'll be heading to Osaka after but I don't want to lug my suitcase around all day.  

I asked the receptionist last night and [they](https://www.sunroute.jp/english//hotelinfo/chugoku_shikoku/hiroshima/index.html "Hotel Sunroute") offer luggage delivery through [Yamato](http://www.global-yamato.com/en/hands-free-travel/ "Yamato Delivery").  
It's cool how they phone your next hotel to confirm everything. It's all so professional~  
It cost ¬•1600 and, even though I could've gone without it in the end, it was worth it.

My suitcase is already getting full. Again, regretting not bringing the big one.  
I still have 3 more hotels to go through too...

Now, free from my burdens, let's go~!

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_08.43.06_samsung-SM-G930F.jpg" >}}  
My bag has a straps for camera equipment but I hang my umbrella on it. \#HandsFree

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_08.45.39_samsung-SM-G930F.jpg" >}}  
Not walking today. Taking the tram instead.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_09.02.35_Sony-DSC-RX100M3.jpg" >}}  
The tram lines make the city feel so much more open. All this space :open_hands:

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_09.08.57_samsung-SM-G930F.jpg" >}}  

>ùïãùï†ùï¶ùï£ùïöùï§ùï•ùïîùï†ùï£ùïñ

The tram was surprisingly empty.  
It's almost 9am so I guess people are already at work by now.  

Goodbye Hiroshima.  
If language barriers didn't exist I'd love to live here.  
Just enough city to feel alive and have things to do but still small and compact.  
And without the huge crowds of Tokyo or Kyoto/Osaka too.

### Hiroshima Station

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_09.31.44_samsung-SM-G930F.jpg" >}}  
I still have time and there's a souvenir shop inside the ticket gates.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_09.31.13_samsung-SM-G930F.jpg" >}}

My luggage won't arrive till tomorrow so my bag is stuffed with overnight items.

I've been thinking about eating this fruit sandwich again for 2 years.  
Damn, this onigiri is also really good.  

## Mihara

### Mihara Station

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_10.29.23_samsung-SM-G930F.jpg" >}}  
Oh, fug. There's no train this hour.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_10.49.36_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
I don't have _that_ much time so I'm just going to hang around the station.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_10.38.22_samsung-SM-G930F.jpg" >}}  
I'll be coming back to this station later so might as well drop some stuff off.  
Guess I didn't need to use the luggage delivery service after all.

Lemon juice flavoured crisps. These were nice but I wouldn't get them again.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_11.06.19_samsung-SM-G930F.jpg" >}}  
Some snacks while I wait. A lemon flavoured manju and [honey lemon candy drops](https://www.kanro.co.jp/en/product/detail/id=1063 "Kanro: Honey Lemon Drops").  

## Tadanoumi

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_11.57.39_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
Finally :relieved:  

Before you head off, turn around into the Family Mart next door.  
They sell vegetables for the rabbits there.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_12.05.37_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
The port is only a 5 minute walk from the station. Just follow the sea.  

### Tadanoumi Port

This is one cute ferry terminal.  
They sell souvenirs and there's a tiny cafe inside.  
Their website is also very cute: http://rabbit-island.info/en/

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_15.52.12_samsung-SM-G930F.jpg" >}}  
Hit the button on the top left for your return ferry ticket.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_12.49.14_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
Even if you bought veggies you should buy some rabbit pellets at the counter.  
There's no rabbit food for purchase on the island so get them now.  
If you return the empty packet they'll give you a postcard.  

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_12.11.30_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}

:ferry: time.

20 minutes later~

## Okunoshima (Rabbit Island)

{{< youtube RdeX4NqvDZw >}}  

>Rabbits On Okunoshima Island Swarm Tourist

It all started when I saw this video a few years ago and thought "I gotta go there".  
It's better to get here early when more rabbits are awake and hungry.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_13.02.47_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
There's rabbits everywhere but don't stop yet.  
The hotel shuttle bus is waiting to take you further inland.

### Park Resort

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_13.05.39_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
There is a single hotel here that has a cafe and souvenir shop.  
There's also a campsite but you can walk round the whole island in a day anyway.  
Or you can rent a bike instead.

### ???

The tallest electricity pylon in Japan is on this island somewhere.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_13.18.04_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
Even the ocean in Japan looks like an anime.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_13.24.44_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
Woops. I was looking for the lighthouse but I walked in the wrong direction.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_13.23.54_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  

>Abandoned poison storehouse

Fun fact: They secretly manufactured poison gas on this island during World War II.  
Rape _and_ chemical weapons. No wonder the Chinese hate Japan.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_13.35.25_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
Some say the rabbits here are descended from the test subjects.  
Though the Japanese Government claim all animals were destroyed.  
The other rumour is that some school kids left their pet rabbits here.  
¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  

There's no natural predators and humans bring them free food so they multiplied.  
They're the baby boomers of the rabbit world.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_13.37.36_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  

>These rabbits are tame compared to their more cautious overseas cousins

There's no one on this side of the island. Just abandoned ruins, rabbits, and me.  
I seem to end up alone a lot...

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_13.48.04_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  

>These 2 have had enough.

Even if you don't see any rabbits, just start rustling your bag and they'll come charging.

Remember:  
Don't feed the rabbits near the road. They'll get distracted and get run over.  
Don't bring your own rabbit. They'll get bullied.  
Don't pick the rabbits up. They don't like it.  

Don't want to spend too long here, already behind schedule from missing that train.

### Park Resort

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_12.56.33_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  

>Is the order a rabbit?

Back at the hotel for lunch.  

There's an english menu but the ticket machine itself is Japanese only.  
I walked back and forth, double checking the signs, like a baka gaijin.  
I could have taken a photo of the menu.

The hotel was having a free lottery for some reason. Anniversary? I dunno.  
I won a postcard :ok_hand:

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_14.09.53_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  

>Matcha sponge cake, cream and iced tea

They gave me the dessert first...

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_14.13.58_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  

>Omelette curry rice and toasted baguettes with lemon/maple syrup

I'm doing that thing again where I order way too much.  
Also the baguettes came with a dollop of ice cream. Is that normal in Japan?

The prices were very reasonable considering this is the only restaurant on the island.  
[Coco's](https://ichibanya.uk/menu/ "Coco Ichibanya UK") in London is almost double the price of this place.

>Only the strong survive

Taking a scenic walk back to the ferry instead of the shuttle bus.

### Visitor Center

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_14.49.58_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
Rabbit ears for listening to the soothing waves of the ocean.  
Or for detecting an invasion from the enemy allied forces. That too.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_14.41.36_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  

>Scale model of the island underneath this glass floor

Dropping by the visitor centre. It's pretty large for such a small island.  
There's a lil museum here too about the local fauna and geology.  

There's a poison gas museum nearby but I must've walked past it.  
I've had enough of traumatizing imagery from the [Hiroshima Peace Museum](/blog/2019/jp19-03 "Japan 2019 Day 3 - Hiroshima~
") anyway.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_14.43.08_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  

I did not feel particularly relaxed.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_14.37.00_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}

Well, that was fun/10.  
If I had more time/wasn't winter I would have liked to see more of the island.  
Explore more of the abandoned ruins and see the beaches.

Onward to the 2nd town of the day!

Expectation: I'll be done with rabbit island by, like, 1pm  
Reality: 4pm  
All that waiting for trains and ferries add up.

I _am_ here for anime reasons but I didn't expect to see this right outside the station.

[Tamayura](https://myanimelist.net/anime/9055/Tamayura "MyAnimeList: Tamayura") was a healing anime about a girl rediscovering her love for photography.  
It was a slow-paced show that somehow gave off a sense of nostalgia.  
A show that never stood out but was always appreciated.  

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_16.27.39_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
I only came in to grab a map but now the old lady is talking to me ahhh.  

Oh wait hey. They have that Tamayura tour map I saw online.  
The obaa-san's face lit up then she ran into the back and found an english copy for me.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-00/2019-02-21_02.34.09_Fujifilm-X-T20_m.jpg" >}}

>When people only visit your town because of a cartoon

I first watched Tamayura almost 10 years ago now, back when I was still in college.  
That was when I was first starting to explore currently airing shows.  
They continued to release new OVAs throughout my uni years and it was always a delight.

I got a wall scroll for the series' finale movie that I didn't really want .  
I felt pressured with the grandma smiling at me and whispering shit like „Å©„ÅÜ„Åã„Å™Ôºü

### Townscape Conservation District

It's not that far of a walk and there are signs pointing you in the right direction.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_16.49.21_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
Takehara has the nickname Little Kyoto thanks to this preserved historical district.  
Well, _Hiroshima's_ Little Kyoto because there's a bunch of towns with that nickname.  

Even then, Takehara isn't the only one in the Hiroshima Prefecture, there's also Onomichi.  
¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Other people: It's a tree  
Me: Omg, look at that tree, it's _so_ Japanese!

Back in the days of the samurai, there were laws restricting the display of wealth.  
These laws included how tall people could build their homes etc.  
So instead the merchants of Takehara would flex on each other with fancy rooftops (kawara)  
and intricate lattice woodworking (koishi) fronting their warehouses.  

You can even enter some of these empty houses for a fee.  
Some others have been converted into museums.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_16.53.21_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}

The (expensive) dolls represent a Heian preiod wedding for the Emperor/Empress.  
They're passed down the family as heirlooms (because they're expensive).  
They used to be played with but now they're just for display (because they're expensive).  
There are multiple tiers so the kids can't reach the more expensive ones at the top.

Part of the town was actually closed until today due to [flooding damage](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-44790193 "BBC July 2018: Japan flood: At least 179 dead after worst weather in decades").  
I didn't see a mention of this on any english websites. Only the town's Japanese website.  
Important reminder to always check the Japanese site too.

It was a good thing I booked hotels with free cancellations.  
I had to re-shuffle my itinerary so many times trying to juggle closures and the weather.

There was an event today to celebrate the re-opening somewhere.  
There was like a mini concert and everything.  
I didn't really look into the details at the time. I decided to visit Okunoshima first instead.

I can't tell if this is another ume tree or not. It's kinda droopy.  
You can imagine what the results are like when you try to google "Japan pink tree".

Fun facts:  
Even though ume translates to plum, the fruits are actually closer to an apricot.  
Most known for making a type of wine, [umeshu](https://www.justonecookbook.com/plum-wine/ "Just One Cookbook: Plum Wine Ê¢ÖÈÖí ‚Äì Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories"), or pickled into [umeboshis](https://tenor.com/search/umeboshi-gifs "Tenor GIFs: umeboshi").  
In Chinese cuisine, the ume is made into a dipping plum sauce for duck or fried food.  

The sakura (cherry) trees produce a type of cherry called a [sakuranbo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy_xbXIJ898 "MOU IKKAI") instead.

>Fumeikaku of Saiho-ji

The tallest viewing deck in the area.  
It houses an 11-faced Kannon statue inside.

It was supposedly modelled after the [Kiyomizu-dera](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kiyomizu.jpg "Wikipedia - File:Kiyomizu.jpg") temple.  
The same famous Kyoto temple I visited back in [2017](https://imgur.com/a/uM2p5 "Imgur - Japan 2017 Day 12").

I walked past a monk and he had a keychain of Tamayura's mascot on his bag.

Some of the scenes in the film "The Girl Who Leapt Through Time" were shot here.  
The 1983 film, not the later anime adaptation.

This view isn't as high up as some cities but that makes it feel more intimate.  
Coming from a mountain-less country, it's cool to see mountains in the background.

According to the tourism guide, this is the highlight of the town.  
It's all downhill from here I guess.

The building used to be a soy sauce brewery 200 years ago.

That pink "cat" thing in the anime screenshot is the anime's mascot, Momoneko.  
The running gag is Fu is always trying to take a photo of him but failing.  
You'll be seeing more from him later.

It's already closed. Guess I'm not having dinner today.  

The whole town is pretty much closed at this time and it's not even 6pm yet.  
Pretty different to the Japanese cities I'm usually in.

The name Takehara itself means something about bamboo fields.  
There's not much bamboo left in the town these days.

Despite being a preserved area, people do still live here.  
There are also cafes, museums and shops selling traditional crafts.  
And they regularly hold festivals and activities in the bigger empty houses.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/tamayura/Hi10_Tamayura_Hitotose_-_02_BD_720p_Nishi-Taku.mkv_snapshot_00.17.267.jpg" >}}

It houses the God of Business Prosperity as well as marks the end of the preserved area.  
Merchants of Takehara would come here to pray for success.

Let's walk back to find some stuff I missed.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/other/2018-11-03_by_masa_taka.jpg" >}}  

>Shokei Square by Masa Taka on Google Maps

The biggest event in Takehara is Shokei no Michi (Candle Festival).  
The entire historical area would be decorated with candles housed in bamboo.  
It has all the usual Japanese festival things like music, dances, shows etc.  
It's actually a fairly new event starting less than 20 years ago.

That bamboo tunnel is only set up during the festival.  

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-05/2019-03-02_17.37.09_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  

>Masataka Taketsuru and Rita Taketsuru

For the rest of the year, the only thing in the square are these two.

Takehara first made their riches by producing salt using innovative (for the time) techniques.  
The modern half of the town is built on top of where the salt plains used to be.  
The town was later known for their sake breweries. Masataka was born into one of those families.  

He studied the art of scotch whisky in Scotland and got himself a Scottish waifu.  
After returning to Japan, he worked at Suntory to establish Japan's first whisky distillery.  
Later, he founded his own whisky company, Nikka. Nowadays, Nikka is owned by Asahi.  
(He never actually came back to Takehara.)

Fun fact: Suntory used to be named Kotobukiya. The same as the anime figure company.  
Fun fact<sup>2</sup>: Suntory now owns the British drinks, Lucozade and Ribena.

Well, I couldn't go in even if I could because they're closed right now.

I get too tunnel-visioned recreating screenshots that I forget to take normal photos.

That wooden thing on the right with the poster is the [Atago Shrine](https://goo.gl/maps/tUiTHAggnAsGCmCGA "Google Maps: "Atago Shrine by „ÅäÁ§æ").  
I also thought it was just some cupboard at the time because the shutters were closed.

Goodbye Takehara.  
I wouldn't recommend it to most people unless the candle festival is going on or something.  
I think I saw less than 10 humans my entire time here.  

It's great if you're looking for a peaceful day away from the crowds.  
Though there are probably tons of towns in the Hiroshima region for that.  
Like the previously mentioned Onomichi for example.

## Mihara

So the train is timed to arrive at Mihara for you to transfer to the Shinkansen...  
...but I still need to grab my things from the lockers.

The next Shinkansen isn't going to stop at this station.  
I'm going to have to take a local train to the next town over to catch it.

I hung my umbrella up on the lugguage rack and it's been swinging back and forth distractingly for the past 30 minutes but I feel like it's too late to take it back down now. Sumi<sup>masennn...</sup>

This pillow is weirdly deep. I think it's so you can fold it to make it thicker.  
I was so tired that I fell asleep with all the lights and TV still on. Oyasumi... :sleeping:  

I woke up later to weird moaning sounds.  
Turns out if you idle on the menu, the TV automatically plays the trailer of the movie.  
And it just leaves those first 5 minutes on loop forever...

Fun fact:  
2/3 of Japan is covered in trees. Only beaten by Finland and Sweden in the developed world.  
Fun fact 2:  
Japan has too many trees, or rather, they planted too many of the same kinds of trees.  
Only a small percentage of Japan's forest today can be considered fully natural.  

They're having a hard time fixing it because all the farmers moved to the cities.  
After losing their jobs because Japan imported cheap trees instead of using their own.  
Which led to all these monoculture forests untended, causing havoc on the environment.

Bonus:  
It's all mainly cedar and cypress trees, which produce a fuckton of pollen during hayfever season.

The oysters were ok.

The lemon cakes were also just ok.  
Like cupcake bread with a mild lemon flavour.

These manju were pretty nice.  
I got the smallest box I could buy which happened to be these Pokemon ones.

Wow, this is a cool box.

Well, I have no use for this.
