## Haneda Airport

Get off the plane.  
Get through passport control.  
Wait for my baggage...oh that was quick.  
Spill my first spaghetti with the customs officer who thought I could speak Japanese.

Hayai, Heathrow needs to step up.

Alright, got through a lot quicker than I was expecting.  
Oh, an ATM, I should get some money out...oh right, my cards are in my luggage.  
OK, there's the JAL ABC counter, I should pick up my sim card then...that's a really long queue.  
Okie dokie, I'll pick up my JR Pass instead...if I can find their office.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-01/2019-02-26_18.23.10_samsung-SM-G930F.jpg" >}}  
Coke **ON**  
_tsumeta~i_

Got my JR Pass. Found an empty corner to sort out my suitcase.  
`>ATM: ERROR READING CARD`  
O-Oh...It said international ATM though.

And...the queue for my sim card has gotten longer.  
One of the reasons why I picked this sim card provider is because they don't deliver to the airport's post office, which closes before I arrive, like all the other providers.  
From Haneda, you can pick it up from either the JAL office or the Lawson instead. I went with JAL because it's on the same floor as arrivals but turns out this is where they handle their baggage delivery service which takes 5-10 minutes per person, since if they're using a delivery service chances are they have a ton of baggage.  

## Minami-Senju, Tokyo

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-01/2019-02-26_19.44.36_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
_Welcome to Tokyo_

Ended up queuing for almost an hour. The Sun had set by the time I got to Tokyo.  
I should've tried to skip the queue by pretending to be a clueless tourist or something. Took them like 15 seconds to hand me my sim card.  

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-01/2019-02-26_22.47.27_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}

Took a bit to set up the sim card. You have to use mobile internet to set up the sim so ~~it can identify the sim card. When you first connect it will pop-up the activation webpage where you enter the sim's number, sms verification, login to your account etc. but like, the internet would time out and cut off.  
Then I would have to restart the phone to re-enable the internet and start again.  
I had to have everything copied to the clipboard, ready to paste into all the forms to get through the whole process fast enough before it would time out again~~.  

OMG, Lemon, no one cares about your technical problems.

Lol woops, not the most flattering shot but I'm in a hurry. After resting a bit at the hotel, it's now 8pm which means most shops are closed and the few remaining will also close soon.

There's been a trend of acrylic plastic with just pictures printed on top for merchandise these past few years. I guess they're super cheap to manufacture but it feels lazy. It's not like they're passing the cost savings to us consumers either.

I only learnt this after I got back but Nadeshico-Sushi is not only a sushi restaurant that employs female sushi chefs, which is already a rarity in Japan, but it is staffed entirely by women.

Toranoana staff confirmed for Ninofags.

The 5toubun anime has been pretty popular. Though not watching it myself since I'm already reading the manga.

Welp, closing time. In hindsight I shouldn't have started browsing on the porn floors first since I decided not to buy any this trip anyway.

I completely forgot I saw and took a photo of this. I saw posters for this later wondering what it was and even bought a box, again, not knowing what it was.

Only in Akihabara will you find figure advertisements in the post office.

I was tempted to get that [Kaguya Luna figure](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/719155) but the face doesn't look that great from any angle that isn't head-on.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-01/2019-02-26_22.10.28_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}
