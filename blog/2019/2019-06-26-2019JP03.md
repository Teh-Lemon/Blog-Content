## Kyoto

This thing was supposed to wake me up but it ran out of battery.  
Ran out of battery just sitting there overnight. Great.  

I'm just laying here in total darkness because I can't turn on the lights without it.  
Reminder that this thing is supposed to be your room key too.  
_F U T U R E_  

Though without the alarm, I finally got a decent night's sleep so oh well.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_08.57.58_-.jpg" >}}  
I would finish what I had planned for yesterday evening but it's raining so...  
There's always next time :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Lobby area has a shared kitchen and a coffee machine.  
I don't recommend paying extra for breakfast. It's just a sandwich.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_09.35.48_samsung-SM-G930F.jpg" >}}  
Hotel also has an open-access roof for smokers.  
I should have gone up to take some photos.

Work-area with fancy ergonomic chairs~

Sound-proof phone booths too.

I give The Millennials Kyoto capsule hotel a :thumbsup:/10.  
One of the nicest places I've stayed at _and_ for less than £25 a night too.

>Good morning, Kyoto.

I give Kyoto a too-many-buses/10.  
Everything is too spread out and the public transport is lacking.

I was looking at a street map and an elderly man asked if I needed help.  
Of course, he didn't know where my station was because I got the name wrong :sweat_smile:  
It's ok, I was only checking the board out of curiosity.

`>taking an escalator down into the station`  
`>suitcase topples over while I was sorting out my umbrella`  
Good thing there wasn't anybody below me h-haha...

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_10.35.02_samsung-SM-G930F.jpg" >}}  
This is one premium-looking bento.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_10.36.10_samsung-SM-G930F.jpg" >}}  
Cute.

The thing I like about Shinkansen stations is that there are still souvenir and food shops past the ticket gates for you to browse while you wait for the train.

Went for a katsu sandwich instead of a bento this time and IT WAS SO GOOD.  
It's simple but the meat had the perfect tenderness, juiciness and oishiiness.  
A refrigerated sandwich has no right being this good.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_11.35.58_samsung-SM-G930F.jpg" >}}  
Had to change Shinkansen lines at Osaka.

Got this skewer in a konbini outside Fushimi Inari.  
I just kinda forgot it was in my bag this whole time.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_11.44.00_samsung-SM-G930F.jpg" >}}

## Hiroshima

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_12.43.54_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  

>wtf I love Hiroshima now

I'm here. First time in Hiroshima...um now what?

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_12.59.38_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
That's an interesting gradient.

>That's a butt.

I was checking out the schedules when a local guide asked if I knew where to go.  
She told me to join this queue for a buses. I didn't want to ride anymore buses...  
You can tell they're local guides by the [funny hats](https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-a-group-of-women-wearing-tour-guide-uniforms-taking-notes-while-training-54325626.html).  

Do I need to boop my SUICA? ...no response. O-Ok then.  
Sitting here, frantically googling if SUICA works in Hiroshima.  
I only have a 10000 yen note on me and I'm not sure if they're accepted on buses...  

`>first result`  
`>"Page does not contain the word Hiroshima"`  
Then why are you showing it to me? Google's algorithm gets worse every day.  

Oh shit oh fuck it's my stop. H-Here goes...it works! Almost...  
Driver told me I should have booped my card before the doors had closed.  
S-Sumimasen...

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_13.24.02_samsung-SM-G930F.jpg" >}}  
This is what greeted me when I stepped off the bus.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_13.26.22_samsung-SM-G930F.jpg" >}}  
Neat.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_13.28.41_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  

>Hotel Sunroute

Just a couple minutes walk away from the main road. I'm liking Hiroshima already.  
Everything is scaled down compared to other cities but simultaneously a lot more open.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_14.02.34_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
Wow. My first proper hotel by myself. I feel like an adult.

They upgraded my room for free. Guess it's not a busy time of the year.  
Um, what's different compared to the basic room I booked? Maybe the bed is bigger?

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_14.02.00_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
Japanese toilets are nice. No poop anxiety here.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_13.57.54_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
Nice view. I didn't realise how close the Peace Park was.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_13.54.52_Fujifilm-X-T20_01.jpg" >}}  
Quick corn soup break.

## Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_14.08.10_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  

>The Memorial Monument to the Victims of the Atomic Bomb Hiroshima Municipal Girls High School

This monument was built when Japan was still occupied by the allied forces.  
They were forced to use the phrase E=MC<sup>2</sup> instead of directly mentioning the atomic bomb.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_14.12.37_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
O-Oh...  
The side building is still open though.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_14.13.50_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  

>Peace "Watch" Tower

>The cogwheel device under the digital displays implicitly warns that human history continues to tick toward its end if nothing is done.  
The device consists of 15 cogwheels lined up from top to bottom.  
The concept is: the cogwheel at the top rotates 100 times per minute, but it will spin faster if the earth shows signs of being in danger. If it reaches the immovable cogwheel at the bottom, the clock will automatically self-destruct.  

>In order to stop the cogwheel from spinning, we must work toward abolishing all nuclear weapons and seek for an age of coexistence among humankind without dependence on military force.  

>The Peace "Watch" Tower reminds us to stop these cogwheels from rotating — reminds us to put our heads together to eliminate nuclear weapons, and reminds us to put an end to our dependence on military force, to live in an age of peaceful coexistence.

There you have it.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_14.14.10_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
It's only ¥200 to enter.

Not sure how many exhibits are missing but it was worth visiting.  
You learn a lot about the effect the bomb had on the civilians, something not often talked about.  
Don't bring the kids though. There were some very disturbing images.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_15.28.56_Fujifilm-X-T20_02.jpg" >}}  

>Memorial Cenotaph  
>"Let all the souls here rest in peace for we shall not repeat the evil."

The arch is positioned to frame the Peace Flame and A-Bomb Dome.  
It also represents a shelter for the souls of the victims written underneath.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_15.30.51_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  

>Peace Flame

The Peace Flame is kept lit until the day there no more nuclear bombs left.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_15.32.03_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  

>Children's Peace Monument  
>"This is our cry. This is our prayer. Peace in the world."

Dedicated to the child victims of the bomb.

In Japanese tradition, folding a [thousand paper cranes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_thousand_origami_cranes) will grant you a wish.  
Most often, people fold paper cranes in hopes of curing an illness.  
The paper cranes are donated from around the world.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_15.34.23_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  

>Sadako Sasaki.

Sadako Sasaki was a girl who died from leukemia after radiation poisoning.  
Her story was even made into a novel called "Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes".

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_15.38.42_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  

>Cenotaph for Korean Victims

There were more than just Japanese living in Hiroshima.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_15.44.20_Fujifilm-X-T20_01.jpg" >}}  

>A-Bomb Dome

The only building that was left standing near the bomb explosion.  

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_15.35.56_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}

## Hiroshima Orizuru Tower

Visiting all the memorials really puts you in a heavy mood.  
The Orizuru Tower, next to the park, has a more uplifting tone.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_16.48.18_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  

>OKOMOKO donburi, namachi chips and iced tea at Akushu Cafe

Okonomiyaki is one of Hiroshima's regional dishes.  
I got the namachi chips because I was curious but it's just salted crisps.  
I don't often feel ripped off in Japan but the tea cost more than the main dish.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_16.08.47_Fujifilm-X-T20_01.jpg" >}}  
There's a souvenir shop on the ground floor too.

They had a staff member supervising the corridor to make sure people don't die.

Went to get a drink.  
The english menu said "Hot Honey Lemon Drink" so I asked for a hachimitsu remon.  
Turns out the japanese menu didn't have the word honey/hachimitsu in it...  
but the cold version of the drink does...

`>If there's a Melonbooks, I wonder if there's a Toranoana`  
Oh, there is. Better hurry, they close a lot earlier here than in Tokyo.

Hai, domo.

>意地悪過ぎる女の子の射精管理遊び by トランスイノベーション

Struggling to figure out the concept for this onahole.  
It's like she pulled out something from the back of the fridge that had mutated.

I looked it up and it comes bundled with an instructional audio CD.  
It's about your little sister who forces you to fuck this disgusting blob while she makes mean comments at you.

Is this the dark souls of porn?

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_20.30.55_samsung-SM-G930F.jpg" >}}  
Is that...

...a _motherfucking JoJo reference?_

How do you go from this...

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_20.34.59_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
...to _this_?

>Kawaikereba Hentai demo Suki ni Natte Kuremasu ka?

Oh hey, it's that thing that got an anime announced recently.  
You can tell by the long name that it's a light novel.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/Kawaiikereba Hentai demo Suki ni Natte Kuremasu ka.jpg" >}}  
Well, this is a thing.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-02-28_20.36.59_samsung-SM-G930F.jpg" >}}  
I don't know how you can make a manga out of Kaguya Luna but there it is.

I got excited thinking [Anmi](https://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=212801) was doing porn but they just drew the front cover.

This feels like a save point.

Cracking open a cold one in the bath.

Woah, the mirror is heated so it stays clear in the middle. Technology~

I like how Google thinks I teleported off the map at some point.  
A more chilled out day compared to yesterday.

### Lüt

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-03/2019-03-02_08.08.45_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
Lemon candy, lemon scent spray, milk jam, paper crane ornament and a Sylphy figure.  
I don't know anything about Desktop Army but this one is designed by [BLADE](https://twitter.com/blade4649) so sure.

Man, I got _the_ most unethusiastic cashier at Melonbooks. Gave me death stares.  
Either I did something wrong or he must've been in a real bad mood.  
Or maybe he just thought my taste was shit.

Toranoana gave me another clear file thing (bottom left).
