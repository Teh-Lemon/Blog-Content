>Good morning, Hiroshima.

4 hours of sleep. Oof.  
Stayed up way too late browsing the internet then woke up early due to jet lag.  

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-04/2019-03-01_06.36.06_samsung-SM-G930F.jpg" >}}  
Why bother training staff when you can leave everything to the AI?  
I couldn't get the kettle station to work so I plugged the kettle into the wall.  

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-04/2019-03-01_06.35.44_samsung-SM-G930F.jpg" >}}  
All my hotel rooms came with an emergency flashlight in case of natural disasters.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-04/2019-03-01_06.48.23_Fujifilm-X-T20_01.jpg" >}}  
15 minutes later, the water finally boiled.  
My phone also never fully charged while I slept.  
The power outlets here are weak, man.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-04/2019-03-01_07.56.08_samsung-SM-G930F.jpg" >}}  
Finally, a coke that's good for you...  
...and I forgot to bring it with me.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-04/2019-03-01_07.58.44_samsung-SM-G930F.jpg" >}}  
I always liked these magnetic cards that you stick on your door.

Trying out a new laundry strategy this trip.  
I'm washing my clothes in the sink and hanging them up to dry overnight.  
Now I can reduce the amount of clothes I need to bring and save space.  
Wore my synthetic running shirt most days because it dries quickly.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-04/2019-03-01_06.09.37_-.jpg" >}}  
First I'm going to check out the Shukkei-en Garden next to Hiroshima Station.  
Hiroshima is a pretty small city so I'm going to walk. Nothing is open yet anyway.  

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-04/2019-03-01_08.03.49_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  

>Hiroshima's tram, the Streetcar

Also it's going to be rush hour soon so I'd rather stay off public transport.

Morning commutes are comfy when you don't have work.

>Shirakami-sha Shrine

Cute shrine in the middle of the city.  
The original was blown away by the bomb but some stone lanterns survived.

>Former place of Kokutaiji Temple and Atago Pond

I took this photo randomly but turns out it has its own marker on Google Maps.  
It would be a chill place but it's noisy next to the main road.

Family Mart selling these cigarette heaters.  
They claim these taste nicer than burning them.

Popped into a 7/11 and a piano version of [Toto Africa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDAylrT8sk8) was playing over the speakers.

## Downtown Hiroshima

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-04/2019-03-01_08.25.43_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-04/2019-03-01_08.34.40_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
I wanted to get off the main road and explore the side streets.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-04/2019-03-01_08.33.50_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
Holy, power lines, Japan.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-04/2019-03-01_08.35.05_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
Men's internet! You can sleep here!

It's an internet cafe.  
Comfy private room. Free library of porn DVDs. Only 2000 yen a night (plus tax).  
I should stay in one of these some day. This one even has VR headsets to rent.

They also offer a telephone club service.  
Where the phone in your room is connected to girls to "chat" with.  
I thought these things died with the invention of the mobile phone.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-04/2019-03-01_08.37.43_Fujifilm-X-T20_01.jpg" >}}

Yup. I'm in _that_ part of town.  
It's surreal seeing all this out in the open. It's either banned or subtle in the UK.  

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-04/2019-03-01_08.39.03_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
They're like a concierge.  
They also seem to have lost control of their web domain.

Wandering around these empty streets is kinda comfy.  
It all feels so innocuous this early in the day.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-04/2019-03-01_09.28.19_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
The whole garden is built around a pond.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-04/2019-03-01_09.51.57_Fujifilm-X-T20_01.jpg" >}}  
The garden contains plants for all seasons including the ume blossoms.  
Best reason to visit at this time of year is the lack of crowds.

The architecture of the garden is designed to look like miniature landscapes.  
I can imagine tiny Dragonball fighters zipping around.

Well, that was lovely/10.  

Spent just under an hour strolling through.  
10am now and more people are starting to show up.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-04/2019-03-01_10.17.17_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}

The main train station is just across the river from the garden.

### Hiroshima Station

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-04/2019-03-01_10.26.39_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
Hello Kitty is here to upsell you on unnecessary packages.

Second brekkie at a bakery.

Melon bread, some sweet bread, curry bread, croquette.  
My brain picked things up without thinking about whether I could eat it all.  
My stomach: why do you do this

The milk tea tastes creamier than in the UK.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-04/2019-03-01_10.35.59_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
Yo, this croquette is good.

## Miyajima Island (Shrine Island)

{{< youtube 0tApRzNUv7k >}}

>Some comfy train ambience for you.

The train announcer at 1:15 was making me sleepy.

There _is_ a direct ferry from Hiroshima to Miyajima Island (AKA Itsukushima Island).  
That ferry isn't covered by the JR Pass though and it's like 3000 yen.  

Instead, take the train from Hiroshima Station to Miyajimaguchi and there's a ferry there.  
Both of these _are_ covered by the JR Pass and doesn't take that much longer.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-04/2019-03-01_11.47.58_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-04/2019-03-01_12.02.09_Fujifilm-X-T20_01.jpg" >}}

Deer live around the island.  
There are signs telling you to be careful with your maps or the deer will eat them.

Oh, boy! Free luck!

>The Belfry

This bell is rung when it is time to start worship.  
Visitors can also ring it to make a wish.  
I could hear this bell going off in the distance every 5 minutes.  

(I already messed up this shot multiple times.  
I should have figured out how video recording works on this camera before the trip.)

### Okonomiyaki Village (Okonomimura)

[Okonomimura](http://www.okonomimura.jp/foreign/english.html) is a building filled with tiny restaurants that specialise in okonomiyaki.  
Okonomiyaki is another one of Hiroshima's local dishes so I had to try it.

The restaurants are completely open so you feel like an auction item while  
walking around as all the workers try to lure you in into their shop.  

\*Elevator opens up right in front of a restaurant\*  
"IRRASHAIMASE"  
\*180 right back into the stairwell\*  
Well, I can't go back onto that floor ever again...

Unlike in Osaka, the chef makes the okonomiyaki for you.  
The ingredients are also layered instead of mixed together.
