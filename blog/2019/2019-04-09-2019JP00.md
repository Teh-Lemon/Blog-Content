Boss: We're closing up shop in a month for a couple of weeks.  
Me: Time to Japan

## Holiday Planning

I wish they would give me more of a heads up. I wanted to travel to multiple cities and a month isn't enough time to prepare everything.  
In the end, I went with a cliche route through the most popular cities because it would be quicker to research.

_"I should check Reddit"_

_"On second thought, let's not"_

[Japan-Guide](https://www.japan-guide.com/) always tops the Google results and I've used it for every trip including this one but I don't think it's very good when researching places to visit. Their descriptions and photos really undersell many of the attractions and don't inspire me. I might have skipped a lot of the things I enjoyed if Japan-Guide was my only source of information.  
Their other guides for getting around Japan are good though. Especially their airport guides with a list of transport options to different areas of the cities are very useful.
Instead I found it much more helpful to trawl through user trip reports on forums like Reddit, Tripadvisor or Youtube. You'll get real opinions on whether places are worth visiting as well as discover new things not covered in a tourist guidebook.  
Another source of information that I found surprisingly helpful were the official tourism websites for each location. Official tourism websites in general can be a bit mainstream but there were tons of details and photos. Make sure you also check the Japanese version (with Google Translate), the English versions are sometimes simplified and lacking news.

This trip I plotted all the places of interest on Google Maps. It was very helpful in visualizing how close things are to each other, getting a general sense of the layout of a city and planning a route for that day. I forgot to recheck my Maps once I actually got there though and ended up walking past a lot of the things I had marked down. Woops.

My local supermarkets seemed to have stopped selling those portable lactose-free milk pouches that I used last time but I found something even better. Now I get to enjoy all of the various Japanese dairy desserts too (not that it ever stopped me before). I can't believe you chumps are still making your own Lactase.

Speaking of chumps...I didn't know there were banks that offered free foreign ATM withdrawals and spendings. I think I've paid almost Â£100 on ATM fees alone over all my previous trips.  These things work online too which would've been nice to know before I bought all those figures and renewed a bunch of US subscriptions.  
My friend got me an up-to-date arcade card just before my boss told me that I would be getting a holiday. Well, better to figure out the transfer purchase now than during the holiday.

Time to reinstall Skype on my phone :nauseated_face:

I've never had much experience looking for hotels before. I stumbled upon New Koyo by luck browsing /jp/ and I found that capsule hotel by literally googling "Kyoto capsule hotel" and picking the first option.

_"Thanks, Kanyavat"_  

I really hate looking for hotels, my eyes just glaze over going through all the different options. Of all the aggregrate websites I found [booking.com](https://www.booking.com) to have the nicer interface and made it easy to cancel hotels as I re-shuffle my plans around. Then I combine that with [Tripadvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/) and a map of all hotels to make my decision. The map wasn't always that helpful as I wasn't familiar with most of these cities but Google does have a feature to overlay major public transport routes in some cities which gave me an idea of where the major stations laid.

_"Is...Is this a love hotel?"_

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-00/hotel-fine-garden-umeda.jpg" >}}
Ah, all the basic amenities.

Why does Google know this? I guess they scan your emails. Creepy.

This time I went with the [Welcome Sim](https://wow-j.com/en/sim_wifi/). Cheaper than my previous provider for my use case and I don't have to return the card at the end.  
You can easily find discounts by googling for "welcome sim coupons" or something similar. Some of the hotels I booked through booking.com also gave out coupons.  
You can earn additional data by watching a bunch of ads. I like how they were all tourism related then suddenly an ad for [Monster Hunter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro6r15wzp2o) out of nowhere.

I was doing research for this town and I found a leaflet for locations that show up in an anime set in the same place. Google indexed the pdf file but I couldn't find anywhere that actually linked to it.  
Again, wishing I had more time because I wanted to re-watch this and take some screenshots with me. I watched a couple of episodes after I got back and had many "Oh I walked past this! I should have taken a photo of it!" moments.

I'm in.

Wow, it's like I'm in Japan already!

Airport food is expensive so I brought my own lunch. Bon appetit!

Got my first big boy camera for the trip, the [Fujifilm X-T20](https://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujifilm_x_t20/).  
I waited till the last minute before buying but if I had checked the [price history](http://www.fujipricewatch.com/product/06293/Fujifilm-X-T20-Silver-price.html) of previous models then I would have known that the price doesn't drop until several months after the release of the new model. I should have bought it earlier and gotten a few weeks of practice in instead of figuring it out during the trip.  
I got it bundled with just the 18-55mm kit lenses.
