Finally, someone released a 1/7 scale figure for Rin that I like enough to buy. This Rin is the first to be released from Alter's second series of Love Live figures.

It's not often that a character gets more than one figure from the same company, unless their name is [Miku](https://myfigurecollection.net/browse.v4.php?current=categoryId&categoryId=1&rootId=0&orEntries%5B%5D=1590&output=2&sort=insert&order=desc&mode=search&year=2018&month=11&domainId=-1) or [Saber](https://myfigurecollection.net/browse.v4.php?current=categoryId&categoryId=1&rootId=0&orEntries%5B%5D=1654&output=2&sort=insert&order=desc&mode=search&year=2018&month=11&domainId=-1). This shows the power of Love Live.

I liked many of the characters when I was watching the show but over time

The problem when a series hits such mainstream popularity is that most of the merchandise produced are then cheap and low quality to match the more casual fans.  
Luckily, there are enough of the otakus in Love Live's audience that there are still the usual higher end products but Rin seemed to be forever cursed with either dull or ugly figures.
