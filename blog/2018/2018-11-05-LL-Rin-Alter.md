Finally, someone released a 1/7 scale figure for Rin that I actually like. This Rin is the first to be released from Alter's second series of Love Live figures.

It's not often that a character gets more than one figure from the same company, unless their name is [Miku](https://myfigurecollection.net/browse.v4.php?current=categoryId&categoryId=1&rootId=0&orEntries%5B%5D=1590&output=2&sort=insert&order=desc&mode=search&year=2018&month=11&domainId=-1) or [Saber](https://myfigurecollection.net/browse.v4.php?current=categoryId&categoryId=1&rootId=0&orEntries%5B%5D=1654&output=2&sort=insert&order=desc&mode=search&year=2018&month=11&domainId=-1). This shows the power of Love Live.

I liked many of the characters when I was watching the show but the only one who hasn't faded from my mind is Rin so I've always been on a look out for a decent scale figure from her.  
Unfortunately, series with such mainstream popularity will have mostly cheap merchandise to cater to the more casual fans.  

Premium products still exist for the [whales](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Whale) but Rin seemed to be cursed with ugly designs.

Alter's first Rin figure went with her ugliest outfit to date. She doesn't even match the style of the rest of the [collection]({{< itl-url "Figures/LL-Rin-Alter-2018/3c43932932eaae9f0d4dce6464238b2a4944936e_hq-collection.jpg" >}}). It's not like there weren't any other cat outfits they could have gone with.

Well, other people clearly liked it as her aftermarket price shot up higher than her launch price.  
Luckily, the reverse happened for Rin 2018.

The new figure uses this outfit from the mobile game. Alter is going with pairs as the theme for their new line to guilt people into buying into the whole set.  
Shame the figures themselves are set in a plain standing pose rather than the sitting-on-a-branch-together pose. Maybe then I would have been tempted to buy both if they did.  
Clicking the image it will take you to the wiki I got it from. Don't read the comments.

Alter did fix this in the next couple of figures. These two can and should be posed together.

## The Photos

She comes in this cool looking clear plastic box. Would probably stand out on the store shelves.

I'll open Shigure later.

This is one thicc metal rod. Figures have come a long way since the days of the _lean_.  
I'm glad they changed the base for the final release. They had been using a plain empty circle for all the promo material. Plus, the petals made it easy to line the figure up with the camera.

And here's a full body shot.

Sun came out. Looks like stage lights.

Obligatory pantie shot. That thigh fold though.

Better shot of her legs.

Looks pretty good on a shelf. Shame about Sun damage.
