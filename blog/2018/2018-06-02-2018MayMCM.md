It's that time of year again.  
The biannual London Comic Con takes place at the Excel Centre in East London and is the biggest convention of its type in the UK. Easily accessed by the cutest rail line, the DLR.

Obligatory photo of this bouncy board outside Tower Gateway.  
Pretty warm today though not scorching like last year.

Without fail, we always bump into Finn.  
This time he's a Doki Doki.

We're in.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Events/MCM/18-May/DSC01044.jpg" >}}
Ow?

You know when your friend mentions that he likes this one thing one time so you always bring it up as if it's his favourite thing.

It's that anime that everybody forgot about.  
I only watched it for the Velma-lookalike but it was quite the ride. Still wouldn't recommend it though.

It's that poster I got that I never put up that came with that game I barely played. Good times.

Waiting for the VR version...

Always gotta visit the Nep booth though I rarely buy anything because most of the collector's items get bundled with the console game and I only Nep on PC.

Toobie.  
I felt kinda bad asking to take their photo because they weren't ready for it and they spent ages preparing their costume and props and an entire crowd of photographers ended up forming.

It's a rock.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Events/MCM/18-May/DSC01061.jpg" >}}
It's another rock.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Events/MCM/18-May/DSC01055.jpg" >}}
Can't escape the loot boxes.

Can't escape _these things_.

It's like that bag of that maid except with the head cut off.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Events/MCM/18-May/DSC01058.jpg" >}}
This is cute.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Events/MCM/18-May/DSC01065.jpg" >}}
It's a Miku.

Finn wasn't the only Doki Doki. The VN was also a popular subject among the artist booths too.

That's a lot of Rems and more keep getting announced.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Events/MCM/18-May/DSC01072.jpg" >}}
Naked Korbo.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Events/MCM/18-May/DSC01071.jpg" >}}
These are cute.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Events/MCM/18-May/DSC01074.jpg" >}}
Cute Italian.  
This was on my wishlist but the level of detail really doesn't justify the price (and it was even higher on launch). Plus the paintwork on the spaghetti is kinda gritty.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Events/MCM/18-May/DSC01075.jpg" >}}
It's a...shoe...

{{< img-tl "Blog/Events/MCM/18-May/DSC01078.jpg" >}}
That's a nice picture. I wonder if I could reverse-Google it from this photo...  
Getting nothing but Pinterest links. Google should just ban these. They never link back to the actual image.  

{{< img-tl "Blog/Events/MCM/18-May/chrome_2018-05-26_04-22-23.png" >}}
Bingo but the link is dead. What if I reverse search this thumbnail though?...

Aha got it.
