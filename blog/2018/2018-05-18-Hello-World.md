# ...again

<!--more-->

New website!
From raw HTML with inlined CSS, to WordPress, to Jekyll and now to Hugo.

I'm giving Hugo a try after reformatting my computer and realising how much crap I'd have to reinstall just to get Jekyll working again along with all its dependencies.  
Plus, my Jekyll sites are always so hacked together to achieve what I want that the original theme code no longer salvageable. I just want to start fresh.

I'm liking Hugo more than Jekyll so far. It feels more streamlined and it's nice that a lot of the features I need are already built-in and won't require plugins.  
I also love that I can overload the theme files to modify it without having to touch the original source.

Using the theme [Cactus Plus](https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-cactus-plus) by Nodejh, which is a fork of [Cactus](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-cactus-theme) by Digitalcraftsman, which is a port of the same [Cactus](https://github.com/nickbalestra/kactus) theme for Jekyll by Nick Balestra, which is also itself a port of the default theme for the static site generator [Cactus](https://github.com/eudicots/Cactus).  
I like the layout but the headings are really ugly and I need to figure out how to disable that table of contents. I'll tweak them later.

I've been wanting to move away from Imgur Albums for a while. It has clearly been abandoned by the developers for features that actually make them money and bugs have slowly crept in over the years.  
And while it has lasted for quite a while so far, image hosts are money-sinks and who knows what the future holds. Just look at all those old broken tutorials hosted with ImageShack, TinyPic, Photobucket etc.

Github has a soft limit of how large free repositories can get and Git isn't designed for large binary files anyway so I need a place to host my photos. I was initially looking at Flickr but they recently got acquired. In the end I decided to host them myself on Amazon S3.  
Sticking with Github Pages for the site hosting. It's free and now they even have HTTPS support for external domains.

We'll see how it all goes.
