## Osaka

## Shin-Osaka Station

Welp.

## Himeji

### Himeji Station

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-07/2019-03-04_11.05.44_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
Another city I can say I've been to.

You can collect a stamp here.  
Apparently a lot of major train stations have them.

Might have mentioned this before but I'm always discovering new things in my photos.  
I tunnel-visioned and didn't even notice that woman collecting her stamp.  
Perfect timing though, lol.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-07/2019-03-04_11.12.07_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
You can see Himeji Castle all the way from the station. Cool.

That is some good game design:  
It gives the players a goal to work towards.  
It serves as a landmark to help them orientate themselves.  

Also note how the castle is the first thing the player will see thanks to:  
The leading lines of the rooftops driving the players attention towards the centre.  
Using the trees and traffic lights to frame the castle

### Himeji Castle

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-07/2019-03-04_11.35.29_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
This path would probably be a lot more beautiful in Spring.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-07/2019-03-04_11.37.16_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
Waa~ Himeji Castle~  
Big, old and white. It even has a moat and everything.  
It's so big that it makes you think that you're close when you still have far to walk.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-07/2019-03-04_11.56.24_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
The castle ground itself is like a mini village.  
All sorts of winding paths and buildings sectioned with tall walls to delay invaders.

#### Nishinomaru Outer Wall

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-07/2019-03-04_11.57.53_samsung-SM-G930F.jpg" >}}  
Before entering the castle, let's go through the outer wall.  
This is where a princess would have lived.

Waa~ Steep.  
I don't recommend wearing the slippers. They're...slippery.  
They also don't come in a large sizes if you're a gaijin giant.

#### Main Castle

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-07/2019-03-04_12.34.09_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
This is where I'd keep my weapons.

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-07/2019-03-04_12.36.40_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
The path is elongated by making you wind around the rooms.  
Some of the rooms will contain a cultural artifact and fun facts.  
Otherwise the castle is _pretty_ empty.

I elected not to wear slippers this time.

Well, that was a thing.  
Pretty on the outside, barren on the inside.  

Makes a nice stop if you're in the Kansai area or on the way to Hiroshima.  
But I wouldn't come during tourist season/weekends where you might have to queue.  

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-07/2019-03-04_13.25.46_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
The internet says to avoid the zoo here and yeah, looks pretty depressing.

There's also a garden here but I wasn't really feeling it. (~foreshadowing~)  
Plus, I'd need to buy another ticket.

So uh, I was gonna go up a mountain, check out a waterfall, eat some beef...  
...but i'm _really_ not feeling it.  
I think the severe lack of proper rest has finally caught up with me.

I guess I can still say I technically visited Kobe?

I was feeling better after crashing on the bed for a few hours.  
My appetite was back again so I visited the [ramen place](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g298566-d3640522-Reviews-Kamitora_Higobashiten-Osaka_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html "Tripadvisor: Kamitora Higobashi") outside my hotel.  
It was always full whenever I walked past but it was empty this time.  

{{< img-tl "Blog/Holiday/2019-JP/Day-07/2019-03-04_16.20.29_Fujifilm-X-T20.jpg" >}}  
I went for their recommended "Best Ramen" and dumpling set. Oishii 😋  
Their kitchen was wide open and it was fun watching them work.

### Namba

Having not learned my lesson, I rushed downtown so the day didn't feel entirely wasted.

There isn't train station close by so I'm going to have to walk the rest of the way.  
Osaka's biggest downside compared to Tokyo.

### Nipponbashi, Denden Town

Nipponbashi isn't anywhere near as big or densely packed as Akihabara.  
This can be both a good and bad thing.

And all the stores, including this Super Potato, are super spacious.  
There's actually room for more than 1 person to pass through a corridor. Imagine that.  

If you have limited time then I recommend doing your anime shopping in Osaka instead.  
It has all the big stores with plenty of variety in independent stores.

That website is still half unfinished and placeholders.  
The Nipponbashi neighbourhood association also runs a cosplay parade every year.  
Though I'm a couple weeks too early for this year's event.

My knock-off Chino wife, Salt, is so cute.

Well, that was fun but I can't hear any of the music. It's too loud in here.

They made a live-action adaptation of that one doujin.

Except instead of a shota it's an actor pretending to be one.

God damn, how far away is this train platform?  
I was following the signs and it just kept going and going...

FUCK Namba station.  
Got lucky and _just_ made it to the last train. Didn't realise they ended so early.  
I could really use that massage right now...

Booty.  
I like how they used Kotone's localised name in the shop but not on the box.  
It also came with that card thing exclusive to Kotobukiya's retail stores.

The Nier music boxes had restocked just in time.  
Though the loop is really short. I wish it at least covered the whole chorus.

Sxaro has to pay the rent somehow.

Himeji is pretty close to Osaka. Plus the Shinkansen makes the journey super quick.
